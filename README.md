# Bunto Issue Bot [![Travis CI - Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/buntobot/bunto-issue-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/buntobot/bunto-issue-bot)
> This bot is responsible for commenting on GitHub issues that haven't had any activity for multiple months.

Due to the fast nature of [Bunto](https://github.com/bunto), issues often can't be reproduced any more after 2-3 months of inactivity.
